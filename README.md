# Acidentes

This project was created by me during my Bachelor's thesis, for the conclusion of
my Bsc. in Geography, for Universidade Federal de Uberl√¢ndia.

At the time I was a lousy programmer, but I powered through and used VB.net to create
a GUI that would allow people to insert traffic accidents in this system. The system 
would geocode the data entered by using code provided by David Bitner.
